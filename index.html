                            Many of us enjoy and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for
                             our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But specific honey varietals known as “active” honeys 
                            have also been utilized throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.

                        Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels 
                        by as much as 11%. Honey may also increase HDL (good)cholesterol by about 3%.

                    <p>
                        Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study, it can 
                        also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan(DM), 
                        a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at 
                        home bt mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.

                        Its High in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may support better health. Small studies in humans show honey’s antioxidants disease could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm those findings.

                    <p>
                        Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.

                    <p>
                        Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.
